Run:
```
yarn
npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc
testrpc
truffle compile
yarn migrate
yarn test
```

In case of problems with contracts on local environment try to use `truffle migrate --reset` 
command instead of `yarn migrate`.

## Contribution
We are using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to make semantic versioning easier. 
This tool requires special commit message convention taken from Angular to determine the type of changes in repository. 
You can read more about Angular commit message conventions [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
Please follow this conventions when you contributing.

## Releasing new version
To release new library version checkout master branch and run `GH_TOKEN=YOUR-GITHUB-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN NPM_TOKEN=YOUR-NPM-TOKEN yarn release` command.
You can also add GH_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN environment variable to your .bashrc (in OSX .bash_profile) file and then simply run `yarn release` command.
Semantic-release needs access to at least GitHub **repo** scope. If you don't know how to generate your personal token, please read 
[this article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). You also have to generate NPM_TOKEN. This 
token is used only to preparing package.json file. Library won't be published to NPM repository until you add "@semantic-release/npm" to **publish** section
in `.releaserc` file.
